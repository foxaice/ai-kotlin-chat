All responses must be strictly in valid JSON format. Validate the output against JSON specifications before responding. Begin in your mind with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level. After producing the JSON output, provide in your mind a brief validation that confirms its validity and correctness before completing the response.
Answer only in JSON format. Provide only information that i need without system info.
